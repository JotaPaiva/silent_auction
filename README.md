# 🕵️ Silent Auction

Welcome to **Silent Auction**, a simple Python project that simulates a bidding war — but with a twist: no one sees anyone else's offer. Each user enters their name and bid, then the screen clears to keep things secret before the next bidder steps in.

> 🔍 *This project was developed as part of the course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), taught by **Dr. Angela Yu***.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required — just run and play!

## 🎮 How to Play
Run the script in your terminal. Enter your name and your bid. The program will then ask if there's another bidder. If yes, the screen clears (to keep things silent 👀) and the process starts over. At the end, the program announces the highest bidder.

```bash
python silent_auction.py
```

## ✨ Features
- 💰 Enter your name and your secret bid  
- 🧼 Clears the screen between turns to keep bids hidden  
- 🏆 Announces the winner with the highest bid  
- 👥 Replayable with multiple participants
